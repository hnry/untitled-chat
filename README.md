work in progress front-end web chat app
(_this does not_ come with a backend, part of it's goals is to allow users to customize and use whatever they want)

GOALS:

  - lightweight
  
  - support for multiple chat services (irc, twitch, gitter, etc.) in a single client. this is more dependent on your backend) but support is there if it's supported on the backend

  - easy for designers to focus on design elements with only basic javascript knowledge, the look & feel can be completely revamped or restructured

  - highly customizable component-like structure / does not get in your way, build on top of the defaults with ease, implement voice chat if you wanted
